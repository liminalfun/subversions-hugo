text: "I am Metis. My father is white Canadian. My mother is Algonquin. My
      identity has changed throughout the years and continues to do so as I grow
      older and as I struggle to find my place within society. As of today, I
      sometimes suffer from imposter syndrome. I sometimes cannot shake the
      feeling of not belonging. I have only heard stories of my mother past
      daily life. I did not share the same reality as her while growing up in my
      household outside of Ottawa. I will never truly understand what it is like
      to grow up with my peers within one’s culture and one’s attachment to
      Mother Earth whilst having these memories tainted by a history marked by
      oppression and scattered with tragedy. It is not to say that I haven’t
      experiences myself some of the consequences of being indigenous in today’s
      modern society: growing up, my traits and my overall physique were much
      more telling of my heritage. I had dark hair and very distinguishable
      features. I looked like my mother and my peers noticed. I was teased and
      taunted in many ways. I remember wishing to myself that I could look like
      my bullies. I wished to erase this physical heritage that I had been
      gifted with. I was in denial and did not want to hear my mother’s stories.
      I have heard all the stereotypes Indigenous people are given. I have
      witnessed abuse towards some in the streets. I was scared of who I was and
      the meaning of it. But I grew older. I grew wiser. I grew curious. I grew
      emotionally. I grew more courageous. I grew to find out that some things
      don’t matter, and others do. My facial features changed. A love for my
      culture emerged, but that is also when the impostor syndrome also first
      appeared. I became white. I finally got what I wished for all those years
      during my youth. Today, I often say I am white passing, that I have this
      privilege. I know that I am privileged in many other ways. I had access to
      the best education of all levels that my parents could offer me. I did not
      have to attend a school where students aged 6 to 17 attended with too
      little teachers and resources. I was privileged to grow up with all the
      opportunities I could have wished for. But there is one question that I
      ask myself often... At what cost? Some would say I am lucky. Although some
      would say I get the best of both worlds, I strongly disagree. As the Metis
      I am, I still feel the effects of the colonialism of indigenous people
      deep down inside of me."
