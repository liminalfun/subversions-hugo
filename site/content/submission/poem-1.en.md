  bio: With over a decade of teaching and leadership experience in the Educational
    system, from elementary school to university level to community settings, as
    former Pedagogical Consultant for the English Montreal School Board, and as
    co-founder of the social enterprise and non-profit inPath, Melissa-Ann Ledo
    embraces the idea that learner-centered education can offer an enriched
    education to all students, of all levels. She strives to provide and inspire
    the implementation of authentic education to lead learners to higher
    achievement, engagement, and creativity, in ways that develop critical
    thinking and communication skills. Ledo is invested in giving back to her
    own local Queer community and voluntarily runs The Queerest Little Ledo
    Productions. Ledo is also a practicing visual artist whose work focuses on
    storytelling. As a researcher Ledo’s interests surround curriculum
    development, ideas of representation, community building amongst educators,
    facilitating through the arts, and the role of allyship, with a focus on how
    to best support youth.

  The guilt of judging other woman in the past crashes over my body like
  stones. 


  The stones hit my naked breasts and bruise. 


  But then they hit the floor around my feet I see them for what they are. 


  Relics of the past, no longer weighing my body 


          down. 




  I focus on healing the wounds they have caused, and can be better now, do better now. 




  My eyes have been open and I step into this change fiercely, and refuse to surround myself with anyone who isn’t committed to rising above the patriarchal colonial imposed 


  action of holding other woman 


      down.




  We 


        climb 


                higher 


                           together. 




  We climb better when we offer our backs.


  Carry each other when our worlds are too heavy. 


  We reach higher when we reclaim ourselves. 


  Embrace fear together.
