  I’ve been digging for a soil to welcome my rotting body

  For a bed of grass that would have my shape,

  For a place to rest, 

  But nowhere, no one, 

  Was rich enough to allow me

  to decay.



  (It doesn’t grow here)



  I have been laying on sheets glued to my skin

  On an empty mattress, 

  My fingers torn and bloody from clinging to the fabric,

  My cheeks red with sweat.

  (Nothing grows here)

  I needed to break the fibres of my muscles to 

  Stand.

  As they were atrophied, 

  Dried to my bones.



  I dreamt of running, 

  Running fast,

  Running until you feel that dangerous metal taste, 

  running, arms open in the blue embrace of dusk

  Feet wet with dew grass. 



  That dream was so strong,

  I awoke confused of my stagnant state



  I needed to unravel like a loose-tied string,

  Gently settling on a piece of furniture

  Like dust



  So, I decided 

  In the glory of night

  In the quiet mausoleum 

  That at sunset I would be new.



  So,



  In the earliest dawn

  I took my body out of bed for the first time in years,

  Walked on my new legs,

  Brushed out my matted hair and

  All of this for what?

  To live. 



  (Finally, 



  I bloomed)



  Pollinizing, 

  Embracing practically everything within the touch of the eye

  Pushing my hands against freedom’s window

  Straightening the wings, I sat on



  I stayed a while, tasting sunshine through my fresh skin

  I was ready to be let in.
