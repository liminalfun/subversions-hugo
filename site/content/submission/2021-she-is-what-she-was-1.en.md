  alt: "After reading her text, that talks about her heritage as an indigenous and
    white woman; I kept imagining the constant metamorphosis that we go under
    when learning about our background and rediscovering our roots. Based on
    that, I did a photoshoot of her and one of the pictures was the \"canvas\"
    for this collage. The other pictures are all from her family's personal
    archive (in both sides). I chose parts of pictures that reflected her
    heritage and her identity as it came to be. That's how the collage \"She is
    what she was\" came to be. "
