  The smell of alcohol swabs is invading our nostrils\
  There is a slight shimmer of nervous sweat on our palms\
  We fill our syringes with testosterone\
  We plunge them into our stomachs\
  We empty them\
  This is what we do, every Wednesday \
  \
  I read somewhere that trans people were created\
  For the same reason fruit was created, not wine\
  Yeast, not bread\
  So that humanity may share in the act of creation\
  I tell you this as we place hello kitty bandaids \
  Where the syringes pierced our skin\
  Adhesive getting stuck in our freshly-sprouted \
  Stomach hairs\
  \
  Each month, we take a video documenting\
  Our voice changes\
  Each month they drop deeper\
  At the start of the videos\
  We reintroduce ourselves\
  Hi, my name is\
  This is my voice\
  Each month we are new people\
  \
  We walk through our neighbourhood \
  Heads held high with the newfound pride \
  Of becoming who we are meant to be\
  Of taking destiny in our hands\
  And forcing it into the shape\
  Of our choosing\
  \
  We run down the streets\
  laughing\
  Out of breath\
  Our footsteps slapping the pavement\
  Like voices repeating:\
  \
  We are here\
  We are here\
  We are here
