  I’m thinking, in a darkened room

  I’m growing, in my own cocoon

  Immobile (with flightless wings),

  Their two eyes: comforting screen

  They’re blinking, in a cloudy space

  Nightfall: stygian embrace

  Their mouths move (exchange a word)

  The clocks smile; They’re reassured

  I’m reassured

  They’re reassured

  I’m reassured



  How might I escape this lackadaisical haze?

  I only know the smile as it’s leaving my face,

  Now I’m counting the days

  And the innumerable ways

  I can go wrong.



  Am I talking too long?

  Gone

  Self-sabotage has left me out in the cold

  (at least, that’s what I’m told)

  But I think I like it here.



  And isn’t that weird?

  No, I’m only overthinking

  Quietly sinking

  I hear the buzz of a swarm

  Maybe it’s warm.



  Must I get out of my head?

  Bugs are stinging, crawling, biting;

  I keep on fighting

  But the heat is inescapable

  Maybe



  I can fumigate my Self of these critical obsessions:

  Emotional repression

  It’s no deception: just a lack of direction

  Upon reflection

  It’s clear; I might simply have



  Time to spend with others

  The colors, they seem brighter

  Feel lighter as we wash away the apathy

  Happily, we sit. we stand. we walk.

  Let us talk



  I’m speaking, in this lambent room

  I’ve outgrown my old cocoon

  Take flight (with symbolic wings)!

  Just two eyes: iridescent gleam
