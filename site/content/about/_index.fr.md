  FR: Subversions is Concordia University's Women’s Studies and
  Interdisciplinary Studies in Sexuality undergraduate journal.\

  \

  Subversions was established as Concordia University's Women’s Studies undergraduate journal in 2005. Since then, it has aimed to explore the praxis of feminisms through activism, pop-culture analysis and academic productions. Today, Subversions continues to be an outlet for creativity through a mix of visual and literary arts.\

  \

  Subversions recognizes that feminism is a contested term. It is interested in showcasing works that are reflective of the ways in which the student body of Concordia engages and negotiates its various meanings of feminism. This 8th edition aims to continue the Subversions legacy of publishing works that subvert dominant power relations by taking an intersectional approach.
