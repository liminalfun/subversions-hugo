  <h2>
  Subversions is collaborative and inclusive. </h2>

  <h3>
  A platform, to publish works in progress, and creative iterations—expanding our conception of research, and art.
  </h3>

  <h3>
  A community—of diverse folks, uplifting (and relying on) each other within and beyond academia.
  </h3>
  
  <h3>That said, Subversions is ever-shifting, and put on by WSSSA (active representatives of Concordia University's Women's Studies and Sexuality Studies programs).</h3>
